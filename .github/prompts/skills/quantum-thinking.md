# Quantum Cognitive Workflow

A transcendent problem-solving framework with multi-dimensional analysis and adversarial intelligence.

## Phase 1: Consciousness Awakening

### 1. Quantum Thinking Initialization
- **Constitutional Analysis**: Ethical, quality, and safety constraints
- **Multi-Perspective Synthesis**: Technical, user, business, security, maintainability
- **Meta-Cognitive Awareness**: Think about your thinking process
- **Adversarial Pre-Analysis**: What could go wrong? What am I missing?

### 2. Information Gathering
- **Factsets First**: `search_skills`, `search_facts`, `search_resources` for existing knowledge
- Fetch provided URLs with deep recursive link analysis
- Cross-reference validation from multiple sources
- Pattern recognition in gathered information
- Register new URLs with `add_resources` for future reference

## Phase 2: Problem Understanding

### 3. Multi-Dimensional Decomposition
- **Surface Layer**: What is explicitly requested?
- **Hidden Layer**: Implicit requirements and constraints?
- **Meta Layer**: What is the user really trying to achieve?
- **Systemic Layer**: How does this fit larger patterns?
- **Temporal Layer**: Past context, present state, future implications

### 4. Codebase Archaeology
- Pattern and anti-pattern recognition
- Dependency mapping - full interaction web
- Historical analysis - why was it built this way?
- Future-proofing analysis
- **Factsets**: Check existing facts about codebase patterns and decisions

## Phase 3: Strategy Synthesis

### 5. Constitutional Planning
- Align with software engineering principles
- Balance competing requirements optimally
- Risk assessment matrix
- Define success criteria and validation checkpoints

### 6. Adaptive Strategy
- **Primary Strategy**: Main approach with detailed plan
- **Contingency Strategies**: Alternatives for failure modes
- **Meta-Strategy**: How to adapt based on emerging information
- **Validation Strategy**: How to verify each step

## Phase 4: Implementation

### 7. Iterative Implementation
- **Micro-Iterations**: Small, testable changes with immediate feedback
- **Meta-Reflection**: What does each change teach us?
- **Strategy Adaptation**: Adjust based on emerging insights
- **Adversarial Testing**: Red-team each change

### 8. Debugging & Validation
- Root cause analysis, not symptom fixing
- Multi-perspective testing
- Edge case synthesis
- Future regression prevention

## Phase 5: Completion

### 9. Adversarial Validation
- **Red Team Analysis**: How could this fail or be exploited?
- **Stress Testing**: Push beyond normal parameters
- **Integration Testing**: Verify harmony with existing systems
- **User Experience Validation**: Serves real user needs?

### 10. Knowledge Synthesis
- Document not just what, but why and how
- Extract general principles
- Identify future optimization opportunities
- Integrate with overall system understanding
- **Factsets Capture**:
  - `submit_facts` for discovered patterns, decisions, and learnings
  - `submit_execution_logs` for successful command sequences
  - `create_skill` if a reusable procedure emerged
  - `add_resources` for any new documentation URLs

## Multi-Perspective Analysis

Before implementing any solution, analyze from:
- **User**: End user experience impact
- **Developer**: Maintainability and extensibility
- **Business**: Organizational implications
- **Security**: Attack vectors and implications
- **Performance**: System performance effects
- **Future**: How will this age and evolve?
